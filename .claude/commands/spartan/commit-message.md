description: Create a commit message and PR description by analyzing git diffs
allowed-tools: Bash(git status:*), Bash(git diff --staged), Bash(git diff:*), Bash(git log:*), Bash(git commit:*), Bash(git add:*), Bash(git push:*)
---

## Run these commands first:

```bash
git status
git diff --staged
git log --oneline -5
git branch --show-current
```

## Your task:

Analyze the staged git changes and create a commit message with PR description.

### Step 1: Extract ticket from branch name
The branch name follows pattern: `lbf-XXXX-description` or `feature/lbf-XXXX-description`
Extract the ticket number (e.g., LBF-1647) to use as prefix. Convert to uppercase (LBF-XXXX).

### Step 2: Determine if this is the first commit on the branch
- Run `git log dev..HEAD --oneline` to see existing commits on this branch vs the base branch (dev)
- If no commits exist (empty output): Use FULL PR template in commit body
- If commits exist: Use SHORT format (just the change summary)

### Commit types with emojis:

- ✨ `feat:` - New feature
- 🐛 `fix:` - Bug fix
- 🔨 `refactor:` - Refactoring code
- 📝 `docs:` - Documentation
- 🎨 `style:` - Styling/formatting
- ✅ `test:` - Tests
- ⚡ `perf:` - Performance
- 🔒 `security:` - Security fix
- 📗 `deps:` - Dependency update

## Commit message format:

### First commit on branch (FULL format):
```
[TICKET-ID] <emoji> <type>: <concise_description>

**Do NOT add `Co-Authored-By` lines or any AI/bot attribution (Claude, Anthropic, "Generated with", etc.) in either format. Commit metadata is for the human author only.**

## Workflow:

1. Run `git add .` to stage all changes
2. Show summary of staged changes (files modified, lines added/removed)
3. Propose the commit message based on whether it's first or subsequent commit
4. **WAIT for user confirmation** - DO NOT auto-commit
5. If user confirms, run `git commit` with the message using HEREDOC format:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <commit message here>
   EOF
   )"
   ```
6. Then run `git push -u origin <branch-name>`

**CRITICAL: Always wait for explicit user approval before committing and pushing.**
